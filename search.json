    "text": "After the 2022-2023 Men’s College Basketball Season came to a close, the biggest name in the new transfer portal wasn’t a surprise. Hunter Dickinson, the 7-foot-1 All-American center from Michigan, had two years of eligibility left and a decision that would change the landscape of college basketball forever.\nComing off an unusual early exit in the NCAA Tournament, a Round of 32 loss to Arkansas, Kansas head coach Bill Self knew he had to change something. The Jayhawks had returning talent, upcoming stars coming in, but they needed a big man to secure the paint. A player who has dominated inside on big stages and can replicate the greats who have come before him.\nThe Dickinson Era…\nWith an outrageous NIL valuation of $800,000, every major program in the country made their pitch. Kentucky, Maryland, Villanova, and Georgetown were all in the race, but Kansas had something the others didn’t. The track record of developing big men into national champions by the 17-time Big 12 Champion head coach, Bill Self.\nFor Self, this was more than just another roster spot, it was a statement to the rest of the nation that the Jayhawks are back. After years of relying on guard-heavy lineups, Dickinson could be the centerpiece of the offense and a game changer in the Big 12.\nAllen Fieldhouse had new life from the moment the season tipped off, with a new face leading the troops. Backed by a program built on legacy, tradition, and excellence, the Jayhaws ranked No. 1 in the AP Preseason Poll. Could Dickinson be the answered prayer of Lawrence?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nHDPerGame &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/Project 1 Data - Dickenson Per Game.csv\")\nHDPer40M &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/Project 1 Data - Dickenson Per 40 Min.csv\")\nHDPer100P &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/Project 1 Data - Dickenson Per 100 Poss.csv\")\nHDadv &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/Project 1 Data - Dickenson Advanced.csv\")\nHDtotals &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/Project 1 Data - Dickenson Totals.csv\")\nS2020.21 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/Project 1 Data - 2020-21 Full Team Season Stats.csv\")\nS2021.22 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/Project 1 Data - 2021-22 Full Team Season Stats.csv\")\nS2022.23 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/Project 1 Data - 2022-23 Full Team Season Stats.csv\")\nS2023.24 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/Project 1 Data - 2023-24 Full Team Season Stats.csv\")\nS2024.25 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/Project 1 Data - 2024-25 Full Team Season Stats.csv\")\nKU.Record.History &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/Project 1 Data - KU Record History.csv\")\nMU.Record.History &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/Project 1 Data - Michigan Record History.csv\")\nKU.MU.Record.History  &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/Project 1 Data - KU vs MU Record.csv\")\n\nKU &lt;- KU.MU.Record.History |&gt; filter(Team ==\"KU\", Season != \"2025-26\")\nMU &lt;- KU.MU.Record.History |&gt; filter(Team ==\"Michigan\", Season != \"2025-26\")\n\nKU24.25 &lt;- KU |&gt; filter(Season == \"2024-25\")\nKU23.24 &lt;- KU |&gt; filter(Season == \"2023-24\")\nMU20.21 &lt;- MU |&gt; filter(Season == \"2020-21\")\nMU21.22 &lt;- MU |&gt; filter(Season == \"2021-22\")\nMU22.23 &lt;- MU |&gt; filter(Season == \"2022-23\")\n\nKUBar &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=KU, aes(x=Season, weight=`C.

With an already established resume, Hunter found ways to make an impact on the star-studded roster in Lawrence.\nTransitioning from the Big 10 to the Big 12 might not seem like a massive difference, but the style and competition level tell a different story. Both conferences are known for their physicality and depth, yet Kansas and Michigan operated in very different systems. So where do these two programs stack up against the rest of the Power 4? Did Dickinson’s arrival ruin the Jayhawks’ established legacy, or did Kansas simply cool off after years of dominance?\n\n\nCode\nNCAAs20_21 &lt;- S2020.21 |&gt; select (School, G, `Points Scored`, `FG%`, TRB, AST) |&gt;

Although neither led the nation statistically, both Kansas and Michigan found ways to return to the NCAA tournament and put together statistically solid seasons.\nLooking across the Power Four, Kansas ranked near the top of total assists, a reflection of Self’s disciplined offensive system. Their points and rebounds per game stayed consistent with other powerhouse programs, but their true shooting percentage stood out among the best. Meanwhile, Michigan, after losing Dickinson, remained competitive, finishing in the upper half of all of these categories.\nSo what was the real reason behind the $800,000 transfer? Was Hunter Dickinson the problem, or was it simply the roster Bill Self built around him?\n\n\nCode\nHDPerGame |&gt; \n  slice(1:5) |&gt; \n  select(Season, Class, Team, MP, PTS, `FG%`,`2P%`, `3P%`, `eFG%`, TRB) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  data_color(\n    columns = vars(MP, `eFG%`,`FG%`),\n    colors = scales::col_numeric(\n      palette = c(\n        \"yellow\", \"orange\", \"red\"),\n      domain = NULL)\n  ) |&gt; \n  data_color(\n    columns = vars(MP, TRB),\n    colors = scales::col_numeric(\n      palette = c(\n        \"#1E3A8A\", \"#3B82F6\", \"#93C5FD\"),\n      domain = NULL)\n  ) |&gt; \n    tab_header(\n    title = \"Dickinson's role changed after after suiting up for the Jayhawks\",\n    subtitle = \"Kansas's Top Transfer of 2023, saw his numbers decline after leaving Michigan \"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\", size=18),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**Source: Sports Reference | By Camden Otto\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=15)\n     ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDickinson's role changed after after suiting up for the Jayhawks\n\n\nKansas's Top Transfer of 2023, saw his numbers decline after leaving Michigan\n\n\nSeason\nClass\nTeam\nMP\nPTS\nFG%\n2P%\n3P%\neFG%\nTRB\n\n\n\n\n2020-21\nFR\nMichigan\n26.0\n14.1\n0.598\n0.607\n0.000\n0.598\n7.4\n\n\n2021-22\nSO\nMichigan\n32.3\n18.6\n0.563\n0.605\n0.328\n0.588\n8.6\n\n\n2022-23\nJR\nMichigan\n32.7\n18.5\n0.560\n0.580\n0.421\n0.587\n9.0\n\n\n2023-24\nSR\nKansas\n32.2\n17.9\n0.548\n0.581\n0.354\n0.573\n10.9\n\n\n2024-25\nSR\nKansas\n30.1\n17.4\n0.526\n0.562\n0.276\n0.543\n10.0\n\n\n\n**Source: Sports Reference | By Camden Otto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the 7-footers’ overall shooting percentages decreasing, he found other ways to make an impact on this roster while rebounding and finding other stars on his team. With a heavy load for the 5-star transfer to fill and a lot of hype built on short success, was Lawrence the best home for Dickinson?\nIn the end, Hunter Dickinson’s time at Kansas will be remembered as a mix of promise and what could have been. He brought leadership, experience, and attention back to the post, qualities any program would value, but the results didn’t quite match the hype. The Jayhawks have been competitive but have not reached their full potential since their historic 2022 championship.\nThis comes to ask, did Dickinson really ruin Kansas basketball, or was Bill Self just another coach navigating the challenges of the transfer portal? For the upcoming season, Bill Self invested in both top freshmen and transfers, rounding out a roster valued at nearly $10 million. But is bringing in fifth-year seniors truly worth the cost and time, or would it be more beneficial to focus on developing young freshmen with untapped potential?"
